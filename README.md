# Pokerogue

This project is a practice in code design. I have no other plans for it other than to experiment with different design 
patterns.

"Pokerogue" is a poortmanteau (poor portmanteau) of Poker and Rogue. Alternatives could be:

* Progueker
* Proguer
* Prokuer

Or some other combination. I am partial to the Puh-rogue-ker pronounciation, but I'm not sure those sounds actually hold
together or that spelling of the word provides the barest suggestion what shape to make your mouth saying it. There is 
something about the jumble of 'p's and 'r's and 'o's and 'u's and 'g's and 'k's all mushed together that defies 
comprehension.

Just as it's mushy terrible name implies: this application has two parts.

1. This is a simulation of poker. Meaning it is comprised of a deck of cards and a set of rules for interpreting 
   combinations of those cards into traditionally understood 'hands'.
   
2. This is a variation on the rogue-genre. Meaning aspects of the game are dynamically modifiable through regular play.

## Why?

This project presents two unique challenges.

1. Poker a clean balance of complexity and simplicity. As a system to model, it's components are minimalistic and 
vulnerable to many different design approaches. I want to explore the advantages and disadvantages of multiple 
   techniques without having to exhaust myself refactoring a complex environment.
   
2. The rogue-like genre has always fascinated me and I want to learn more about the coding paradigms behind it. There is
a flexibility to the rules of a rogue-like game that imply an astonishingly dynamic backend. I want to explore what an 
   application looks like when it's very foundation is modifiable during runtime.
